   - protocol version 0.1.
   - tincd kernel interface code imported, more supported platforms
     (native/linux (2.4), tincd/linux (2.2 and 2.4), tincd/freebsd,
     native/cygwin).
   - added primitive ethernet emulation (ipv4 only), which allows
     the following platforms that only have tun drivers to work:
     /* none yet tested */
   - portability workarounds, especially for unfriendly freebsd
   - very minor bugfixes
   - warnings when choosing insecure ciphers/hashes

   - protocol version 0.1.
   - tweaked various timeouts to help very slow (486) class
     machines or nets with many hosts.
   - tweaked rate-limiting to be more forgiving for hosts
     connecting through routers (not a fix).
