2.2  Mon Sep  1 06:28:09 CEST 2008
	- protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases,
          but upgrade is recommended to due changed ondemand behaviour.
        - new per-node options max-ttl and max-queue.
        - convert from iom.C to libev, a high-performance event loop
          (http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev).
        - tcp connections were leaking in some cases.
        - retry more aggressively (once/s) to establish a connection if
          new packets arrive for it.
        - save a lot of setsockopt calls when the tos doesn't change.
        - honor disabled even on initial connect attempt.
        - changed callback mechanism to be slightly less portable
          but more efficient mechanism (standards-compliant c++ compilers
          should work).
        - increased receive window positive size, to allow for massive
          packet loss due to occasional longer drop-outs.
        - send RST when a positive window size violation is detected, but
          not in other cases, to reconnect more quickly.
        - upgraded liblzf to version 3.4.
        - dropped -fno-exceptions due to ev++.h using it.
        - node-up/down scripts are now run in sequence.
        - new -q switch for gvpectrl, for when you run it often.
        - work around the horribly inconsistent, ad-hoc, ever-changing
          and broken texinfo syntax. YMMV. avoid texinfo.
        - keepalive is more aggressive now, sensding ping's every 3 seconds
          and killing the conenction after 15 seconds.
        - bugfixes.

2.01 Thu Mar 29 19:26:04 CEST 2007
	- protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
        - bugfix of callback.h, might have cause callback return values to
          be corrupted on architectures like sparc before.
        - dns transport retries more aggressively.
        - updated documentation, improved dns transport reliability
          and throughput.
        - added experimental support for sha256 and sha512 digests.

2.0 Mon Dec  5 13:59:26 CET 2005
	- protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
        - implement allow-direct, deny-direct node config statements.
        - implemented != for sockinfo. This fixes a bug where
          gvpe sent packets to the old ip address of another host
          even though it had received packets from it's new address.
          This only causes problems if you forget to -HUP your gvpe after
          your ip address changed, which is *required*.
        - sets close-on-exec flag on tcp connections. This fixes a bug
          where child processes kept tcp connections open and caused
          connections to fail when only one side can connect.
        - fixed a bug in receive sequence checking that made gvpe
          accept out-of-window packets in most cases.
        - tighter limit for the maximum sequence # to avoid overflow
          conditions + allow more headroom for packet reordering.
        - replace some asserts that trapped config mismatches by
          more useful log messages.
        - fix spurious extra newline in some log messages.

1.9 Tue Apr 19 06:21:50 CEST 2005
	- protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
        - WARNING: this version checks the return value of if-up etc.
          scripts and exits on failure.
        - IMPORTANT: run if-up/node-up etc. scripts via /bin/sh.
        - IMPORTANT: interface initialization (MAC, MTU) is now done
          automatically in most configurations.
        - options can now be specified on the gvpe command line, too.
        - make some DNS transport values configurable and document them.
        - improved OS specific information in gvpe.osdep(5).
        - new tap device type "native/darwin", that supports the tap
          driver available for darwin (thanks to matthew mead who tested
          it out with me in a long session). tincd/darwin is still available.
        - new device type "tincd/bsd", which is a newer version of the
          *bsd-drivers taken from tinc.
        - fixed a bug in relying on the order of global construction
          when tcp transport was enabled. The fix makes it use no
          cpu time unless it is in use, too.
        - information about other nodes is now available to if-up etc. scripts.
        - the value of the config variable if-up-data is passed to the if-up
          etc. scripts.
	- skip unparsable config lines with a warning instead of stopping
          parsing and continuing with a certainly unusable config.

1.8 Fri Mar 18 00:58:55 CET 2005
	- protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
	- enable-udp = yes is now default only when no other protocols
          are enabled. otherwise it is disabled unless explicitly enabled.
        - implemented dns tunneling (experimental now and in the future).
        - remove support for pre-release version protocol.
        - updated tincd drivers (rev 1433), added uml_socket driver, documented
          tincd drivers a bit better.
        - document icmp configuration values.
        - document transport protocols in gvpe.protocol(7).
        - remove unused ChangeLog file.
        - created a mailinglist at gvpe@lists.schmorp.de.
        - added an exemption to allow distribution of binaries linked against
          OpenSSL, as suggested by Guus Sliepen (author of tinc). No
          GNUTLS conversion in sight.
        - some portability fixes with respect to --disable-nls.

1.7 Tue Feb 22 23:58:59 CET 2005
	- protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
	- first gnu release.
        - documented the special value 1 for router-priority.
        - renamed vped => gvpe and vpectrl => gvpectrl, as well as
          vped.conf => gvpe.conf.
	- new per-node option "max-retry".
	- asymmetric rekeying behaviour, so hosts don't rekey simultaneously.
        - new configure option --enable-static-daemon.
        - fix configure --help output.
        - many documentation layout fixes.
        - synced iom.[Ch] from rxvt-unicode.
        - try to cope with some non-monotonic time changes.
        - revert to locale.h - a usual, clocale is nonfunctioning on macosx.
        - considerably improved pod2texi and the resulting texi doc.

1.6.1 Wed May 12 14:48:20 CEST 2004
	- protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
	- fix -c switch that has been broken due to a last-minute fix
	  to option and config file parsing.

1.6 Mon May 10 20:55:10 CEST 2004
	- protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
	- do not RESET on out-of-sequence packets (good for wireless).
	- various non-security-related bugfixes.
	- c++ify (at least make it compile with g++-3.4, which should make
	  it a little bit more standard c++).

1.5 Fri Jan 30 00:50:04 CET 2004
	- protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
	- vped will refuse to start when hostkey and public key do not match.
	- updated lzf code to version 1.2.
	- better error reporting for "unusual" conditions, like failing
	  to allocate memory, that should not normally happen and
	  will otherwise result in spurious other error messages. Also
	  adds paranoid checks in case openssl's API changes in a bad way.
	- fix a bug where queued vpn packets were cleared to zero. while
	  this doesn't affect security, it did cause warning messages and
	  unnecessary connectivity delays.

1.4 Sat Jan 17 15:49:21 CET 2004
	- protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
	- better retry behaviour on key mismatch.
	- use select-based io_manager instead of poll-based one.
	- share io manager between rxvt-unicode and vpe.
	- sooo many *BSD workarounds because no BSD I could find is even
	  remotely POSIX-compatible.

1.2 Fri Oct 17 03:44:44 CEST 2003
	- protocol version 0.1.
	- tincd kernel interface code imported, more supported platforms
	  (native/linux (2.4), tincd/linux (2.2 and 2.4), tincd/freebsd,
	  native/cygwin).
	- added primitive ethernet emulation (ipv4 only), which allows
	  the following platforms that only have tun drivers to work:
	  /* none yet tested */
	- portability workarounds, especially for unfriendly freebsd
	- very minor bugfixes
	- warnings when choosing insecure ciphers/hashes
	- reduced default hmac length to 8.
	- cvs now contains configure, Makefile.in and other generated files.
	- added doc/complex-example to the distribution.

1.0 distant past
	- protocol version 0.1.
	- tweaked various timeouts to help very slow (486) class
	  machines or nets with many hosts.
	- tweaked rate-limiting to be more forgiving for hosts
	  connecting through routers (not a fix).
