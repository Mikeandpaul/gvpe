	- enable-udp = yes is now default only when no other protocols
          are enabled. otherwise it is disabled unless explicitly enabled.

1.7 Tue Feb 22 23:58:59 CET 2005
	- protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
	- first gnu release.
        - documented the special value 1 for router-priority.
        - renamed vped => gvpe and vpectrl => gvpectrl, as well as
          vped.conf => gvpe.conf.
	- new per-node option "max-retry".
	- asymmetric rekeying behaviour, so hosts don't rekey simultaneously.
        - new configure option --enable-static-daemon.
        - fix configure --help output.
        - many documentation layout fixes.
        - synced iom.[Ch] from rxvt-unicode.
        - try to cope with some non-monotonic time changes.
        - revert to locale.h - a usual, clocale is nonfunctioning on macosx.
        - considerably improved pod2texi and the resulting texi doc.

1.6.1 Wed May 12 14:48:20 CEST 2004
	- protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
	- fix -c switch that has been broken due to a last-minute fix
	  to option and config file parsing.

1.6 Mon May 10 20:55:10 CEST 2004
	- protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
	- do not RESET on out-of-sequence packets (good for wireless).
	- various non-security-related bugfixes.
	- c++ify (at least make it compile with g++-3.4, which should make
	  it a little bit more standard c++).

1.5 Fri Jan 30 00:50:04 CET 2004
	- protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
	- vped will refuse to start when hostkey and public key do not match.
	- updated lzf code to version 1.2.
	- better error reporting for "unusual" conditions, like failing
	  to allocate memory, that should not normally happen and
	  will otherwise result in spurious other error messages. Also
	  adds paranoid checks in case openssl's API changes in a bad way.
	- fix a bug where queued vpn packets were cleared to zero. while
	  this doesn't affect security, it did cause warning messages and
	  unnecessary connectivity delays.

1.4 Sat Jan 17 15:49:21 CET 2004
	- protocol version 0.1, compatible with older releases.
	- better retry behaviour on key mismatch.
	- use select-based io_manager instead of poll-based one.
	- share io manager between rxvt-unicode and vpe.
	- sooo many *BSD workarounds because no BSD I could find is even
	  remotely POSIX-compatible.

1.2 Fri Oct 17 03:44:44 CEST 2003
	- protocol version 0.1.
	- tincd kernel interface code imported, more supported platforms
	  (native/linux (2.4), tincd/linux (2.2 and 2.4), tincd/freebsd,
	  native/cygwin).
	- added primitive ethernet emulation (ipv4 only), which allows
	  the following platforms that only have tun drivers to work:
	  /* none yet tested */
	- portability workarounds, especially for unfriendly freebsd
	- very minor bugfixes
	- warnings when choosing insecure ciphers/hashes
	- reduced default hmac length to 8.
	- cvs now contains configure, Makefile.in and other generated files.
	- added doc/complex-example to the distribution.

1.0 distant past
	- protocol version 0.1.
	- tweaked various timeouts to help very slow (486) class
	  machines or nets with many hosts.
	- tweaked rate-limiting to be more forgiving for hosts
	  connecting through routers (not a fix).
