.SH "NAME"
vped.conf \- vpe daemon configuration file

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The vpe config file consists of a series of lines that contain \f(CW\*(C`variable
= value\*(C'\fR pairs. Empty lines are ignored. Comments start with a \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR and
extend to the end of the line. They can be used on their own lines, or
after any directives. Spaces are allowed before or after the \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR sign or
after values, but not within the variable names or values themselves.
.PP
The only exception to the above is the \*(L"on\*(R" directive that can prefix any
\&\f(CW\*(C`name = value\*(C'\fR setting and will only \*(L"execute\*(R" it on the named node, or
(if the nodename starts with \*(L"!\*(R") on all nodes except the named one.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&   name = value
\&   on branch1 loglevel = noise
\&   on !branch2 connect = ondemand
.Ve
.PP
All settings are executed \*(L"in order\*(R", that is, later settings of the same
variable overwrite earlier ones.
.SH "ANATOMY OF A CONFIG FILE"
.IX Header "ANATOMY OF A CONFIG FILE"
Usually, a config file starts with global settings (like the udp port to
listen on), followed by node-specific sections that begin with a \f(CW\*(C`node =
nickname\*(C'\fR line.
.PP
Every node that is part of the network must have a section that starts
with \f(CW\*(C`node = nickname\*(C'\fR. The number and order of the nodes is important
and must be the same on all hosts. It is not uncommon for node sections to
be completely empty \- if the default values are right.
.PP
Node-specific settings can be used at any time. If used before the first
node section they will set the default values for all following nodes.
.SH "CONFIG VARIABLES"
.IX Header "CONFIG VARIABLES"
.Sh "\s-1GLOBAL\s0 \s-1SETTINGS\s0"
.IX Subsection "GLOBAL SETTINGS"
Global settings will affect the behaviour of the running vped daemon, that
is, they are in some sense node-specific (config files can set different
values on different nodes using \f(CW\*(C`on\*(C'\fR), but will affect the behaviour of
the vped daemon and all connections it creates.
.IP "loglevel = noise|trace|debug|info|notice|warn|error|critical" 4
.IX Item "loglevel = noise|trace|debug|info|notice|warn|error|critical"
Set the logging level. Connection established messages are logged at level
\&\f(CW\*(C`info\*(C'\fR, notable errors are logged with \f(CW\*(C`error\*(C'\fR. Default is \f(CW\*(C`info\*(C'\fR.
.IP "node = nickname" 4
.IX Item "node = nickname"
Not really a config setting but introduces a node section. The nickname is
used to select the right configuration section and must be passed as an
argument to the vped daemon.
.IP "private-key = relative-path-to-key" 4
.IX Item "private-key = relative-path-to-key"
Sets the path (relative to the config directory) to the private key
(default: \f(CW\*(C`hostkey\*(C'\fR). This is a printf format string so every \f(CW\*(C`%\*(C'\fR must
be doubled. A single \f(CW%s\fR is replaced by the hostname, so you could
use paths like \f(CW\*(C`hostkeys/%s\*(C'\fR to fetch the files at the location where
\&\f(CW\*(C`vpectrl\*(C'\fR puts them.
.Sp
Since only the private key file of the current node is used and the
private key file should be kept secret per-host to avoid spoofings, it is
not recommended to use this feature.
.IP "ifpersist = yes|true|on | no|false|off" 4
.IX Item "ifpersist = yes|true|on | no|false|off"
Should the tun/tap device be made persistent, that is, should the device
stay up even when vped exits? Some versions of the tunnel device have
problems sending packets when vped is restarted in persistent mode, so
if the connections can be established but you cannot send packets from
the local node, try to set this to \f(CW\*(C`off\*(C'\fR and do an ifconfig down on the
device.
.IP "ifname = devname" 4
.IX Item "ifname = devname"
Sets the tun interface name to the given name. The default is OS-specific
and most probably something like \f(CW\*(C`tun0\*(C'\fR.
.IP "rekey = seconds" 4
.IX Item "rekey = seconds"
Sets the rekeying interval in seconds (default: \f(CW3600\fR). Connections are
reestablished every \f(CW\*(C`rekey\*(C'\fR seconds.
.IP "keepalive = seconds" 4
.IX Item "keepalive = seconds"
Sets the keepalive probe interval in seconds (default: \f(CW60\fR). After this
many seconds of inactivity the daemon will start to send keepalive probe
every 5 seconds until it receives a reply from the other end.  If no reply
is received within 30 seconds, the peer is considered unreachable and the
connection is closed.
.IP "mtu = bytes" 4
.IX Item "mtu = bytes"
Sets the maximum \s-1MTU\s0 that should be used on outgoing packets (basically
the \s-1MTU\s0 of the outgoing interface) The daemon will automatically calculate
maximum overhead (e.g. udp header size, encryption blocksize...) and pass
this information to the \f(CW\*(C`if\-up\*(C'\fR script.
.Sp
Recommended values are 1500 (ethernet), 1492 (pppoe), 1472 (pptp).
.Sp
This value must be the minimum of the mtu values of all hosts.
.IP "ip-proto = numerical-ip-protocol" 4
.IX Item "ip-proto = numerical-ip-protocol"
Sets the protocol number to be used for the rawip protocol. This is a
global option because all hosts must use the same protocol, and since
there are no port numbers, you cannot easily run more than one vped
instance using the same protocol, nor can you share the protocol with
other programs.
.Sp
The default is 47 (\s-1GRE\s0), which has a good chance of tunneling through
firewalls (but note that the rawip protocol is not \s-1GRE\s0 compatible). Other
common choices are 50 (\s-1IPSEC\s0, \s-1ESP\s0), 51 (\s-1IPSEC\s0, \s-1AH\s0), 4 (\s-1IPIP\s0 tunnels) or 98
(\s-1ENCAP\s0, rfc1241)
.IP "if-up = relative-or-absolute-path" 4
.IX Item "if-up = relative-or-absolute-path"
Sets the path of a script that should be called immediately after the
network interface is initialized (but not neccessarily up). The following
environment variables are passed to it (the values are just examples):
.RS 4
.IP "CONFBASE=/etc/vpe" 4
.IX Item "CONFBASE=/etc/vpe"
The configuration base directory.
.IP "IFNAME=vpn0" 4
.IX Item "IFNAME=vpn0"
The interface to initialize.
.IP "MTU=1436" 4
.IX Item "MTU=1436"
The \s-1MTU\s0 to set the interface to. You can use lower values (if done
consistently on all hosts), but this is usually ineffective.
.IP "MAC=fe:fd:80:00:00:01" 4
.IX Item "MAC=fe:fd:80:00:00:01"
The \s-1MAC\s0 address to set the interface to. The script *must* set the
interface \s-1MAC\s0 to this value. You will most likely use one of these:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   ip link set $IFNAME address $MAC mtu $MTU up # GNU/Linux
\&   ifconfig $IFNAME ether $MAC mtu $MTU up      # FreeBSD
.Ve
.IP "IFTYPE=native" 4
.IX Item "IFTYPE=native"
.PD 0
.IP "IFSUBTYPE=linux # or freebsd, darwin etc.." 4
.IX Item "IFSUBTYPE=linux # or freebsd, darwin etc.."
.PD
The interface type (\f(CW\*(C`native\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`tincd\*(C'\fR) and the subtype (usually the os
name in lowercase) that this vpe was configured for. Can be used to select
the correct syntax to use for network-related commands.
.IP "NODENAME=branch1" 4
.IX Item "NODENAME=branch1"
The nickname of the current node, as passed to the vped daemon.
.IP "NODEID=1" 4
.IX Item "NODEID=1"
The numerical node id of the current node. The first node mentioned in the
config file gets \s-1ID\s0 1, the second \s-1ID\s0 2 and so on.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Here is a simple if-up script:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&   #!/bin/sh
\&   ip link set $IFNAME address $MAC mtu $MTU up
\&   [ $NODENAME = branch1 ] && ip addr add 10.0.0.1 dev $IFNAME
\&   [ $NODENAME = branch2 ] && ip addr add 10.1.0.1 dev $IFNAME
\&   ip route add 10.0.0.0/8 dev $IFNAME
.Ve
.Sp
More complicated examples (using routing to reduce arp traffic) can be
found in the etc/ subdirectory of the distribution.
.RE
.IP "node-up = relative-or-absolute-path" 4
.IX Item "node-up = relative-or-absolute-path"
Sets a command (default: no script) that should be called whenever a
connection is established (even on rekeying operations). In addition
to the variables passed to \f(CW\*(C`if\-up\*(C'\fR scripts, the following environment
variables will be set:
.RS 4
.IP "DESTNODE=branch2" 4
.IX Item "DESTNODE=branch2"
The name of the remote node.
.IP "DESTID=2" 4
.IX Item "DESTID=2"
The node id of the remote node.
.IP "DESTIP=188.13.66.8" 4
.IX Item "DESTIP=188.13.66.8"
The numerical \s-1IP\s0 address of the remote host (vped accepts connections from
everywhere, as long as the other host can authenticate itself).
.IP "DESTPORT=655 # deprecated" 4
.IX Item "DESTPORT=655 # deprecated"
The \s-1UDP\s0 port used by the other side.
.IP "STATE=UP" 4
.IX Item "STATE=UP"
Node-up scripts get called with STATE=UP, node-down scripts get called
with STATE=DOWN.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Here is a nontrivial example that uses nsupdate to update the name => ip
mapping in some dns zone:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&   #!/bin/sh
\&   {
\&     echo update delete $DESTNODE.lowttl.example.net. a
\&     echo update add $DESTNODE.lowttl.example.net. 1 in a $DESTIP
\&     echo   
\&   } | nsupdate -d -k $CONFBASE:key.example.net.
.Ve
.RE
.IP "node-down = relative-or-absolute-path" 4
.IX Item "node-down = relative-or-absolute-path"
Same as \f(CW\*(C`node\-up\*(C'\fR, but gets called whenever a connection is lost.
.IP "http-proxy-host = hostname/ip" 4
.IX Item "http-proxy-host = hostname/ip"
The \f(CW\*(C`http\-proxy\-*\*(C'\fR family of options are only available if vpe was
compiled with the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-http\-proxy\*(C'\fR option and enable tunneling of
tcp connections through a http proxy server.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`http\-proxy\-host\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`http\-proxy\-port\*(C'\fR should specify the hostname and
port number of the proxy server. See \f(CW\*(C`http\-proxy\-loginpw\*(C'\fR if your proxy
requires authentication.
.Sp
Please note that vpe will still try to resolve all hostnames in the
configuration file, so if you are behind a proxy without access to a dns
server better use numerical \s-1IP\s0 addresses.
.Sp
To make best use of this option disable all protocols except tcp in your
config file and make sure your routers (or all other hosts) are listening
on a port that the proxy allows (443, https, is a common choice).
.Sp
If you have a router, connecting to it will suffice. Otherwise tcp must be
enabled on all hosts.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&   http-proxy-host = proxy.example.com
\&   http-proxy-port = 3128       # 8080 is another common choice
\&   http-proxy-auth = schmorp:grumbeere
.Ve
.IP "http-proxy-port = proxy-tcp-port" 4
.IX Item "http-proxy-port = proxy-tcp-port"
The port where your proxy server listens.
.IP "http-proxy-auth = login:password" 4
.IX Item "http-proxy-auth = login:password"
The optional login and password used to authenticate to the proxy server,
seperated by a literal colon (\f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR). Only basic authentication is
currently supported.
.Sh "\s-1NODE\s0 \s-1SPECIFIC\s0 \s-1SETTINGS\s0"
.IX Subsection "NODE SPECIFIC SETTINGS"
The following settings are node\-specific, that is, every node can have
different settings, even within the same vped instance. Settings that are
executed before the first node section set the defaults, settings that are
executed within a node section only apply to the given node.
.IP "udp-port = port-number" 4
.IX Item "udp-port = port-number"
Sets the port number used by the \s-1UDP\s0 protocol (default: \f(CW655\fR, not
officially assigned by \s-1IANA\s0!).
.IP "tcp-port = port-number" 4
.IX Item "tcp-port = port-number"
Similar to \f(CW\*(C`udp\-port\*(C'\fR (default: \f(CW655\fR), but sets the \s-1TCP\s0 port number.
.IP "enable-rawip = yes|true|on | no|false|off" 4
.IX Item "enable-rawip = yes|true|on | no|false|off"
Enable the \s-1RAW\s0 IPv4 transport using the \f(CW\*(C`ip\-proto\*(C'\fR protocol
(default: \f(CW\*(C`no\*(C'\fR). This is the best choice, since the overhead per packet
is only 38 bytes, as opposed to \s-1UDP\s0's 58 (or \s-1TCP\s0's 60+).
.IP "enable-udp = yes|true|on | no|false|off" 4
.IX Item "enable-udp = yes|true|on | no|false|off"
Enable the UDPv4 transport using the \f(CW\*(C`udp\-port\*(C'\fR port
(default: \f(CW\*(C`yes\*(C'\fR). This is a good general choice since \s-1UDP\s0 tunnels well
through many firewalls.
.IP "enable-tcp = yes|true|on | no|false|off" 4
.IX Item "enable-tcp = yes|true|on | no|false|off"
Enable the TCPv4 transport using the \f(CW\*(C`tcp\-port\*(C'\fR port
(default: \f(CW\*(C`no\*(C'\fR). Support for this horribly unsuitable protocol is only
available when vpe was compiled using the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-tcp\*(C'\fR option. Never
use this transport unless you really must, it is horribly ineffiecent and
resource-intensive compared to the other transports.
.IP "router-priority = positive-number" 4
.IX Item "router-priority = positive-number"
Sets the router priority of the given host (default: \f(CW0\fR, disabled). If
some host tries to connect to another host without a hostname, it asks
the router host for it's \s-1IP\s0 address. The router host is the one with the
highest priority that is currently reachable. Make sure all clients always
connect to the router hosts, otherwise conencting to them is impossible.
.IP "connect = ondemand|never|always|disabled" 4
.IX Item "connect = ondemand|never|always|disabled"
Sets the connect mode (default: \f(CW\*(C`always\*(C'\fR). It can be \f(CW\*(C`always\*(C'\fR (always
try to establish and keep a conenction to the given host), \f(CW\*(C`never\*(C'\fR
(nevr initiate a connection to the given host, but accept connections),
\&\f(CW\*(C`ondemand\*(C'\fR (try to establish a connection on the first packet sent, and
take it down after the keepalive interval) or \f(CW\*(C`disabled\*(C'\fR (node is bad,
don't talk to it).
.IP "inherit-tos = yes|true|on | no|false|off" 4
.IX Item "inherit-tos = yes|true|on | no|false|off"
Wether to inherit the \s-1TOS\s0 settings of packets sent to the tunnel when
sending packets to this node (default: \f(CW\*(C`yes\*(C'\fR). If set to \f(CW\*(C`yes\*(C'\fR then
outgoing tunnel packets will have the same \s-1TOS\s0 setting as the packets sent
to the tunnel device, which is usually what you want.
.IP "compress = yes|true|on | no|false|off" 4
.IX Item "compress = yes|true|on | no|false|off"
Wether to compress data packets sent to this host (default: \f(CW\*(C`yes\*(C'\fR).
Compression is really cheap even on slow computers and has no size
overhead at all, so enabling this is a good idea.
.SH "CONFIG DIRECTORY LAYOUT"
.IX Header "CONFIG DIRECTORY LAYOUT"

.IP "vped.conf" 4
